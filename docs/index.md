## About

MitzaSQL is a free Python3 TUI MySQL client for Linux which aims to provide an easy-to-use console alternative to GUI clients. It is not meant to be a full-fledged GUI client, it only provides a read-only view of the database, though you can manipulate the data by using raw SQL queries. Some of the main features are:

* Manage multiple sessions
* View databases
* View list of tables, sql views & stored procedures in a database
* View rows in a table or sql view:
* Easily sort table data
* Filter table data using VIM-like commands (`:like`, `:gt`, `:lt`, `:in`...)
* SQL Query editor with syntax highlighting, <strong>smart autocomplete</strong> and clipboard support (optional dependency needs to be installed)
* VIM style keyboard shortcuts
* VIM style commands with autocomplete support
* Macros support

MitzaSQL is heavily inspired by [HeidiSQL](https://github.com/HeidiSQL/HeidiSQL) and its licensed under [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). The lexer's tokens implementation used by the auto complete system was taken from the [python-sqlparse](https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse) project.
  
Demo and screenshots are available [here]({{ "/screenshots" | relative_url }}).
